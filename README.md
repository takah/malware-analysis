## How to capture all network traffic of a single process
> If the process is not started yet, you can start it as a new process and monitor it using the following
```
strace -f -e trace=network -s 10000 <PROCESS WITH ARGUMENTS>;
```
> If the process is already started and you know its PID you can use the following
```
strace -f -e trace=network -s 10000 -p <PID>;
```
